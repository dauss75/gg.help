Installing Globus Endpoints
###########################

.. topic:: How to Set Up New Endpoints

    - Please visit `Globus Connect <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect>`_ 
    - Select `Globus Connect Personal <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`_ if you are researchers and other end users 
    - Select `Globus Connect Server <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server>`_ if you are network and system administrators
    - The web link should be self-explanatory with all the details on installation; however, for any issues and questions please contact us at support@globus.org

.. topic:: How to Transfer Data

    - Login to your Globus Genomics instance
    - From the tool panel, go to **Globus Data Transfer** -> **Browse and Get Data via Globus Online**
    - Set **Source Endpoint** and **Source Path** and then click **Execute** 
    - For bulk transfers, please contact us at support@globus.org

Exome-Analysis Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++
- Sample datasets to try out.
    - After logging into the instance, under the tools on the left hand menu, go to “Globus Data Transfer” -> “Browse and Get Data via Globus Online”.
    - Search and select “sulakhe#SequencingCenter”
    - when prompted, provide username: genomics and password: globus
    - for exome-seq-pipeline, click “Exome-seq-sample-data” and transfer the Exome-Sample-Forward and Exome-Sample-Reverse sample files one-by-one. (we are adding multi-file transfers soon to this interface).
    - You don’t have to transfer the dbsnp and 1000G files as they are on the instance already.

- Getting the dbsnp and 1000G-indels files from Shared library:
    - Go to “Shared Data” -> “Data Libraries” from the top menu.
    - Select the “Reference Data Library” and you should see the two files.
    - select them (Check box) and import to current history by clicking “Go”
- Steps 3 and 4 should give you everything you need to run the exome analysis pipeline.
- Running the Exome analysis:

    - To get the sample exome workflow, Go to “Shared Data” -> “Published Workflows” and you should see "Illumina Complete Exome Analysis Pipeline”.
    - Import the workflow by clicking “Import Workflow” on the top right.
    - To run the workflow: Go to “Workflow” on top menu where you should see your imported workflow.
    - click on the workflow and “Run”.
    - By this time, if you already have the 4 input files required in the right-hand history panel, you should be able to select them in the Run interface
    - Make sure you select the appropriate Forward and Reverse fastq files for BWA and then appropriate dbsnp and 1000G indels files for other tools.
    - For Step 2: Add or Replace Groups, you can provide: ID = Test, SM = Test, LB = Test, PL = Illumina, PU= 100.
    - And click the “Run Workflow” button at the bottom screen.

RNA-Sample based Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Access to http://labbiomed.globusgenomics.org

    - Register at www.globus.org and send us your login names.
    - We will invite you to join the group created for this project.
- Sample datasets to try out.

    - After logging into the instance, under the tools on the left hand menu, go to “Globus Data Transfer” -> “Browse and Get Data via Globus Online”.
    - Search and select “sulakhe#SequencingCenter”
    - when prompted, provide username: genomics and password: globus
    - for RNAseq samples, click “RNA-seq-sample-data” and transfer all the files one-by-one. (we are adding multi-file transfers soon to this interface).
- RNAseq workflow:

    - Either import the RNAseq workflow from the front page or go to “Shared Data” -> “Published Workflows”.
    - The workflow might already have globus transfers pre-defined to pull the data from the SequencingCenter endpoint.
    - Run the workflow and make sure all the required parameters are filled or selected appropriately.
    - If you have any questions let us know.
